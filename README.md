Recurrent neural networks can also be used as generative models.

This means that in addition to being used for predictive models (making predictions), they can learn the sequences of a problem and then generate entirely new plausible sequences for the problem domain.

Generative models like this are useful not only to study how well a model has learned a problem but also to learn more about the problem domain itself.
